This web app: **features a white pixelated board that when hovered over will
fill the squares black. Color can be changed to a desired RGB value 
and there is also a rainbow option. The canvas can be set from 2 X 2 squeares 
all the way up to 64 X 64 squares. There is also an erase and clear button
so the user can undo the colors.**
